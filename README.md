# Video 5: üìΩÔ∏è Adding Custom Angular Animations to our to-do app 

Our to-do app is functional with the ability to add and remove to-do items to the to-do list. We are using Kendo UI buttons and a textbox input to make this UI happen & it‚Äôs looking pretty good with our custom styles easily modifying the Kendo components. The only thing that is missing in the UX is motion! Some animations would really snazzify our app while providing useful feedback as well as a spatial mental model to our users. Let‚Äôs do this!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
