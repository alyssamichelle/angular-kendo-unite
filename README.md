# Video 4: üìΩÔ∏è A Snazzy to-do app using Kendo UI 

What is a button without a form? What is a to-do list without to-do items? We will answer these philosophical questions, along with other form related ones in this third video of the Angular and Kendo Unite series.

We start with a to-do app using our marvelous Kendo UI Buttons as individual to-do items. We then add in the Kendo UI textbox input and get our to-do app fully functioning! 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
